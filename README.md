# masqr-middleware

masqr-middleware is a quick and simple middleware implementation for [Masqr](https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev/MasqrProject), a licensing backend which helps prevent URL leaks, by providing a one time password for users to enter before they can access any content associated with the page.

# Building

To build, simply run `pnpm i`, and then `pnpm run build` to build it, the build output will be in `dist/`!
